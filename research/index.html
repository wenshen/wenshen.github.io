<h2 id="_research-topics_"><em>Research Topics</em></h2>
<p>I am generally interested in <em>multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and game theory</em>. My research has been primarily driven by the following intriguing question: <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><em>How can we design effective incentive mechanisms/information structures/learning algorithms to help stakeholders make quality decisions that are robust and resilient in the presence of  uncertainty and strategic behavior?</em> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I believe solutions to this problem can help us gain insights into how to tackle some of the most pressing social challenges that include traffic congestion, climate change, epidemics, misinformation propagation and cyber attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Game-Theoretic and Learning Foundations for Robust Moving Target Defense  (2019 &ndash; ongoing)</strong> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<a href="https://wshen.net/paper/Li_MTD20.pdf"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>Moving target defense has emerged as a critical paradigm of protecting a vulnerable system against persistent and stealthy attacks. To protect a system,  a defender proactively changes the system configurations to limit the exposure of security vulnerabilities to potential attackers. In doing so, the defender creates asymmetric uncertainty and complexity for the attackers, making it much harder for them to compromise the system. In practice, the defender incurs a switching cost for each migration of the system configurations. The switching cost usually depends on both the current configuration and the following configuration. Besides,  different system configurations typically require a different amount of time for an attacker to exploit and attack. Therefore, a defender must simultaneously decide both the optimal sequences of system configurations and the optimal timing for switching. In this research, we propose a Markov Stackelberg Game framework to precisely characterize the defender&rsquo;s spatial and temporal decision-making in the face of advanced attackers. Our work opens up new avenues for future research towards robust moving target defense.</p>

<p><strong>Mechanism Design with Thresholding Agents (2016 &ndash; ongoing)</strong> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<a href="https://wshen.net/cv/Defense_Wen.pdf"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>In many real-world scenarios, individual agents' interests are often not fully aligned, in fact, they can even be conflicting with a principal&rsquo;s objectives. The principal needs to take measures to influence agents' decisions or behavior to achieve desirable system-wide outcomes. A powerful tool for motivating self-interested agents to cooperate is to offer incentives for their efforts (e.g. cooperation or sacrifices) by committing to some allocation and payment rules. This approach to implementing the incentive rules is called mechanism design. Despite its promising prospects in addressing some of the most challenging societal issues, mechanism design has not leveraged its full potential due to assumptions such as full rationality, direct preference revelation, and no group manipulation. In this project, we introduce a unified framework called <em>mechanism design with thresholding agents</em> (MDTA) to relax some of those unrealisticassumptions. The proposed approach integrates a series of new techniques that include modeling agents' decision-making with cutoff policies, indirect preference revelation, and using contests to increase competition among agents to counter group manipulations. Our work extends traditional mechanism design by providing a systematic approach to influencing agents' behavior for desirable objectives.</p>

<p><strong>Regulating Systems of Autonomous Machines for Social Good (2011 &ndash; 2017)</strong> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<a href="https://wshen.net/presentations/HAI2017_Crandall.pdf"><!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>Systems of independent autonomous machines or agents, are rapidly becoming an important part of much of the world&rsquo;s critical infrastructure. As with human societies, regulation, wherein a governing body designs rules and processes for the society, plays an important role in ensuring that autonomous machine systems meet societal objectives. However, to date, a careful study of interactions between a regulator and autonomous machine systems is lacking. In this project, we report a series of user studies that give insights into how to design systems that allow people, acting as the regulatory authority, to effectively interact with autonomous machine systems.</p>
