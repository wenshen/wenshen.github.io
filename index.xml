      <description>Research Topics I am generally interested in multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and game theory. My research has been primarily driven by the following intriguing question: How can we design effective incentive mechanisms/information structures/learning algorithms to help stakeholders make quality decisions that are robust and resilient in the presence of uncertainty and strategic behavior? I believe solutions to this problem can help us gain insights into how to tackle some of the most pressing social challenges that include traffic congestion, climate change, epidemics, misinformation propagation and cyber attacks.</description>
